For a smoother implementation, MPI_Comm_size, and MPI_Comm_rank in the main function. Then, pass these values as inputs to the my_custom_reduction function.
---
The return type of your my_custom_reduction function is double, but in case of an error (when the number of processes is less than 2), you return EXIT_FAILURE, which is of type int. It would be more consistent to return a double value representing the failure.
---
Instead of using dynamic arrays with new and delete, consider using std::vector or static allocation. This can make your code more readable and reduces the risk of memory leaks.
