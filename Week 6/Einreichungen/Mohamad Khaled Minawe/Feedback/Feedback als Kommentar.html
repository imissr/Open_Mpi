<p>Don't upload build files. (*.o files)<br>---<br>Task 7.1:<br>=========<br>Your code uses the same buffer for both sending and receiving in the root process. It may lead to incorrect behavior or even buffer overflow.<br>---<br>The myArray had to be initialized just in root process.<br>---<br>In the timing section, you have to add an MPI_Barrier before starting the timer to ensure that all processes start their computation at the same time. Same after each timing section<br>---<br>There are some commented-out code blocks. If they are not needed, consider removing them for cleaner code.<br>---<br>Task 8:<br>=======<br>Ensure proper indentations, and avoid unnecessary indentation, such as in lines 13-25.</p>
